<!--
Ensure you have read over [Submitting Issues](https://github.com/chocolatey/.github/blob/main/SUBMITTING-ISSUES.md)

Please check to see if your issue already exists with a quick search of the issues. Start with one relevant term and then add if you get too many results.

NOTE: Keep in mind we have a [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/chocolatey/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community.

Name your issue appropriately: give it a sentence that reads well enough for anyone seeing this in the release notes to what it is.

When writing out the issue details please ensure you are writing it as if you were explaining it to somebody else.
Even if you will be working on and resolving the issue yourself. This helps others to understand the reasons for the issue and for it to be searchable in future.
