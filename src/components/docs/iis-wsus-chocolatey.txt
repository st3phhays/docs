If you are running Chocolatey Products, namely Simple Server or Central Management, next to a WSUS admin-site, you need to change some settings in the IIS-Configuration for making the Simple Server/Central Management Web interface work correctly again.
This is due to the fact that the WSUS admin-site installation registers two modules in the IIS root configuration, which will be passed down to all other sites running on that IIS instance, including the Simple Server and Central Management sites.

To make things work again, you will need to disable inheritance for these modules in order to remove them from the Chocolatey product site you are working with.

*Before making changes to your IIS configuration, read all steps carefully and make sure that you have a backup*

You can do this either by PowerShell:
``` powershell
# Import WebAdministration
Import-Module WebAdministration

# Remove locks from modules
Remove-WebConfigurationLock -Filter "system.webServer/modules/add[@name='DynamicCompressionModule']" -PSPath IIS:\
Remove-WebConfigurationLock -Filter "system.webServer/modules/add[@name='StaticCompressionModule']" -PSPath IIS:\

# Remove modules from the Chocolatey Simple Server site
Disable-WebGlobalModule -PSPath 'IIS:\Sites\ChocolateyServer\' -Name DynamicCompressionModule
Disable-WebGlobalModule -PSPath 'IIS:\Sites\ChocolateyServer\' -Name StaticCompressionModule

# Restart website
Stop-Website -Name "ChocolateyServer" #Or ChocolateyCentralManagement
Start-Website -Name "ChocolateyServer" #Or ChocolateyCentralManagement
```
or manual:
  1. Open the IIS Management Console
  2. Click on the server name on the upper left pane
  3. On the right pane double-click on `Modules`. All available modules will show up
  4. Search for `DynamicCompressionModule`, right-click it and choose `Unlock`
  5. Do the same for `StaticCompressionModule`
  6. Under `Sites` on the left pane click on the site for your Chocolatey Simple Server, most likely `ChocolateyServer`
  7. Again, search for `Modules` on the right pane and double-click it
  8. Search for `DynamicCompressionModule`, right-click it and choose `Remove`
  9. Restart the Chocolatey Simple Server/Central Management site

The website should now be able to handle requests correctly again.
