## Maintenance and Support Contract Considerations for Perpetual License Customers

Having a Maintenance and Support contract with Chocolatey Software, Inc. consists of two parts:

- Maintenance - allows you to download newer versions of the licensed components of Chocolatey.
- Support - allows you to submit issue tickets to our Helpdesk and also have access to our Support Team.

During the active period of the contract, you have access to both `Maintenance` and `Support`.
Once that expires, you would simply need to purchase that contract again to continue access to newer versions of those components.

A Perpetual License means that you have a license which never expires and you are able to use the Chocolatey Licensed Extension with versions of Chocolatey CLI that are compatible.
While your Maintenance contract is valid, you are able to download updates to the licensed components.

A Perpetual License customer that does not have an active Maintenance contract will not be in a position to upgrade to the latest version of Chocolatey Licensed Extension.
This can cause problems when there is a dependency that exists between a new version of Chocolatey CLI and Chocolatey Licensed Extension.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> We added the dependency requirement to the [release notes](xref:choco-release-notes#march-21-2022) of v1.0.0 of Chocolatey CLI but some customers continued to experience the issue.
> In the [v1.0.1](xref:choco-release-notes#march-24-2022) and the [v1.1.0](xref:choco-release-notes#march-30-2022) releases of Chocolatey CLI we implemented changes to allow Chocolatey CLI to work with the latest version of Chocolatey Licensed Extension. There are no guarantees that these changes will be applied in the same way to future versions.

If you are in this position, we suggest that you take one of the following actions:

- Request a Maintenance and Support contract renewal, upgrade the Chocolatey Licensed Extension to the latest  version and then upgrade Chocolatey CLI.
- Forego the Maintenance and Support contract renewal and stay with the version of Chocolatey CLI and Chocolatey Licensed Extension that you use. To prevent accidental upgrade of Chocolatey CLI we would suggest that you [pin](xref:choco-command-pin) to the version you use and ensure you are using an [internal repository](xref:organizational-deployment-guide).
