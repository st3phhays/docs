> It is not possible to use both the [HideAllRemoteChocolateySources](xref:hide-all-remote-chocolatey-sources) and the [HideThisPCSource](xref:hide-this-pc-source) features at the same time.
> Doing this would effectively mean that there is nothing to display within the Chocolatey GUI Application.
> If both of these features are enabled at the same time, the HideAllRemoteChocolateySources feature takes precedence and only the This PC source will be displayed.
