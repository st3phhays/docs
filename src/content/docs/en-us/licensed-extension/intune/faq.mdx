## General FAQs

### Why Does the Intune Install of Chocolatey CLI Require a Restart of the Computer?

During the installation of Chocolatey CLI, a number of environment variables are set or updated. This includes the `PATH` environment variable that tells Windows where to look for programs to run. The only reliable way to ensure that these are updated prior to running any subsequent Chocolatey CLI commands is to inform Intune that the package requires a restart to complete installation.

### Why Do I Need All of the Chocolatey Products if I'm Not Using Them?

In order to ensure upgrades of Chocolatey CLI behave as expected, we need to include all Chocolatey products for distribution in the Intune package whether they are curently being used or not. Without this requirement, deployments through Intune could result in upgrades of any Chocolatey components failing due to an inability to find required dependencies.

## Intune Convert Command

### Do I Need to Use `choco convert` For All Dependencies of a Chocolatey Package?

If a Chocolatey package has dependencies, Chocolatey CLI will convert each of them to a Chocolatey Intune package.

### Must I download all of the Chocolatey package dependencies before conversion?

It is recommended that all package dependencies are converted to ensure that the package installs and upgrades correctly, and to ensure the software functions as intended. If the dependencies do not exist either locally or in your Intune tenant you may be prevented from pushing the Chocolatey package.

With the above recommendations in mind, if you do need to skip converting package dependencies, use the `--ignore-dependencies` switch when running the `convert` command.

### I get an error message about `convert` not being available

The `convert` command is currently a preview feature, and the feature configuration `allowPreviewFeatures` needs to be enabled. This feature can be enabled by running:

~~~sh
choco feature enable --name=allowPreviewFeatures
~~~

### I get an error about `Stream was too long` when I try to convert a package

When trying to convert packages that are larger than around 2 GB, you may encounter the error `[IntuneWinAppUtil] ERROR  System.IO.IOException: Stream was too long.` There is a [known issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool/issues/58) with version 1.8.3 of `intunewinapputil` which is used to generate the Chocolatey Intune package `intunewin` file. You can work around this by either downgrading to `1.8.2.20220507` with the command `choco upgrade intunewinapputil -y --version 1.8.2.20220507 --allow-downgrade`, or you can upgrade to the latest intunewinapputil with the command `choco upgrade intunewinapputil -y`.

### I get an error about `The handle is invalid` when I try to convert a package

When trying to convert packages with `intunewinapputil` version 1.8.5 installed, you may encounter the error `[IntuneWinAppUtil] ERROR  System.IO.IOException: The handle is invalid.` There is a [known issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool/issues/111) with version 1.8.5 of `intunewinapputil` which is used to generate the Chocolatey Intune package `intunewin` file. You can work around this by either downgrading to `1.8.4.20220726` with the command `choco upgrade intunewinapputil -y --version 1.8.4.20220726 --allow-downgrade`, or you can upgrade to the latest `intunewinapputil` with the command `choco upgrade intunewinapputil -y`.

## Push to Intune Command

### Can I push a custom version of the `chocolatey-license` package?

Yes, but there are a few things to know before doing so:

1. If there is no `chocolatey-license` package on the Intune tenant, ensure you push this package to Intune first. Otherwise, a new `chocolatey-license` package will be generated and will replace the custom one in your local directory.
1. The Chocolatey package ID must be `chocolatey-license`.
1. It must have been converted to a Chocolatey Intune package by calling `choco convert`.

### How can I update my license in the Intune tenant when I have a new Chocolatey for Business license?

Follow these steps to do this:


1. Ensure the local computer that you will run the Chocolatey CLI commands on has the new license applied to it.

1. Login to the Intune tenant and locate the `Chocolatey License` package.
1. Replace the `Notes` section of the Intune package with a non-whitespace character (for example, the letter A).
1. Push a package to Intune as you would normally do. This will result in Chocolatey automatically generating a new `chocolatey-license` package using the license present on the local computer running the `push` command.
1. Locate the `Chocolatey Licensed Extension` package in the Intune tenant and add the new `Chocolatey License` package, created above, as a dependency and remove the previous `Chocolatey License` package as a dependency.


### What can I do if I receive an error about my file not being found or not being a `nupkg` file?

The command to `push` a Chocolatey Intune package (a package with the `intunewin` extension) is currently a preview feature, and the feature configuration `allowPreviewFeatures` needs to be enabled by running:

~~~sh
choco feature enable --name=allowPreviewFeatures
~~~

### What can I do if I receive an error about the format of the URI could not be determined?

The command to `push` a Chocolatey Intune package (a package with the `intunewin` extension) is currently a preview feature, and the feature configuration `allowPreviewFeatures` needs to be enabled by running:

~~~sh
choco feature enable --name=allowPreviewFeatures
~~~
