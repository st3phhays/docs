title: Allow Non Admin Access to Settings
description: Controls whether or not a non-administrator user can access the Settings Screen.  NOTE - This feature will only work when using the licensed extension for Chocolatey and Chocolatey GUI.

import Xref from '@components/Xref.astro';

When using Chocolatey GUI for Business a new feature is available in the Settings screen:

![Allow non-admin access to Settings](/images/chocolatey-gui/allow_non_admin_access_to_settings.png "Allow non-admin access to Settings")

Which controls whether or not a non-admin user has access to the Settings screen or not.

By default, this setting is enabled, so that we don't introduce a breaking change in the way that the application has worked to date.  However, at some point, this will likely be flipped to not allowing non-admin users to access the settings.

When this setting is turned off, a non-admin user will no longer be able to access the Settings screen, as shown below:

![Access to Settings screen removed](/images/chocolatey-gui/access_to_settings_removed.png "Access to Settings screen removed")

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Regardless of this setting, an administrator user will always be able to access the Settings screen.
