title: Use Keyboard Bindings
description: Allows keyboard bindings to be used to interact with different areas of the Chocolatey GUI User Interface
---

By default, Chocolatey GUI ships with some keyboard bindings that make navigating sources easier when using the
keyboard.  In the screenshot below, it is possible to navigate to the `chocolatey.licensed` feed using `CTRL + 3` and
then back to the `This PC` feed using `CTRL + 1`.  It is also possible to navigate to the `chocolatey` feed using
`CTRL + 2`.

Disabling this feature will stop these navigations from being possible using these keyboard shortcuts, but they can
still be navigated to using the mouse in the normal way.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
>Keyboard bindings are only supported for the first 9 sources.  Trying to press `CTRL + 1 + 0` for navigating to a tenth source will not work.
