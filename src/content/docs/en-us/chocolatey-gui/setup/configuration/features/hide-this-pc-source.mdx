title: Hide This PC Source
description: Allow control over whether Chocolatey GUI should show the local This PC source or not
---
import Xref from '@components/Xref.astro';

There are times when you want to simplify the usage of Chocolatey GUI for your end users, and only show the sources where packages can be installed from, rather than including a source which lists all of the currently installed packages.  When this feature is enabled, Chocolatey GUI would change from showing the following:

![Hide This PC Source Disabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_hide_this_pc_source_disabled.png "Hide This PC Source Disabled")

to only showing the available remote sources which are currently configured on the system:

![Hide This PC Source Enabled](/images/chocolatey-gui/feature_hide_this_pc_source_enabled.png "Hide This PC Source Enabled")

Notice that the "This PC" source is no longer available.

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/require-chocolatey-gui-licensed-extension-note.txt" /?>

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/restart-required-warning.txt" /?>

<?! Include "../../../../../shared/hiding-sources.txt" /?>
