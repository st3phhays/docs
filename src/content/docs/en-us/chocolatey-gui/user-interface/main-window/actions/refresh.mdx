Chocolatey GUI, by default, will automatically check for the currently installed packages, and will fetch the first page of results when looking at remote sources, when navigating to a source when the application first loads.  However, this functionality can be configured using the <Xref title="Prevent Preload" value="prevent-preload" /> feature, or there can be changes to packages outside of Chocolatey GUI.  When these situations occur, you can manually refresh the current list of packages using the following button:
