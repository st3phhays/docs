You can remove any of these packages from your repository without using them by logging into Nexus, browsing to the `ChocolateyTest` and `ChocolateyInternal` repositories, and deleting the package from each.

## Custom Packages

You can add custom packages using the `Specify any other packages` textbox.

Please provide these as a comma-separated list, e.g.

```text
nexus-repository, notepadplusplus, sublimetext3
```

> :choco-warning: **WARNING**

> We recommend you review and test all packages before internalizing and deploying them from the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages).

## Adding Packages Post-Deployment

You can download and internalize packages after the deployment of your environment.

To do so, log into Jenkins at `https://<FQDN>/jenkins`, and click the `Schedule a Build...` icon on the right of the `Internalize packages from the Community Repository` job. This will take you to a screen where you can add Package IDs as a semicolon-separated list to the `P_PKG_LIST` parameter, e.g.

```text
nexus-repository; notepadplusplus; sublimetext3
```

Start the internalize job by clicking `Build`.

The specified packages will then be downloaded and pushed to your ChocolateyTest repository, ready for testing, and then be promoted to the ChocolateyInternal repository either by you or by the `Update production repository` job.

There are further details on these default jobs <Xref title="here" value="automate-package-internalization" anchor="create-jenkins-jobs" />.
