## FAQ

### Can I open up the Chocolatey Central Management Service's port to allow machines to report in from anywhere?

For best results, we recommend using a VPN connection for client check-ins.
The Chocolatey Central Management service connection is authenticated over SSL, but our best practice recommendation is to secure the connection over a VPN as well.
With Chocolatey Central Management v0.3.0+, more security has been put into allowing for checking in over internet connections. We _highly_ recommend setting both a `centralManagementClientCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword` and `centralManagementServiceCommunicationSaltAdditivePassword` Chocolatey configuration value on your client machines and Chocolatey Central Management Service host machine.
