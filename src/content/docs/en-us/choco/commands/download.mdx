# Download Command (choco download)

### Package Copy / Package Downloader

[Chocolatey Professional](https://chocolatey.org/compare) and up (Pro+) starting in version 1.7.1.

Downloads a package from a source and unpacks it.

### Package Internalizer

[Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) (C4B) starting at licensed version 1.5.0.
Chocolatey for Managed Service Providers (MSP) starting in 1.12.1.

Downloads a package from a source, optionally downloading remote
 resources and recompiling the package to use internal resources. This
 takes an existing package and makes it available without any internet
 requirement.

See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-internalizer


## Usage

    choco download <pkg> [<options/switches>] [install_script_variable=value]

    Install script variables are values that are discovered in the
     chocolateyInstall.ps1 (or a script it calls). When you find values
     there maybe don't get found and replaced or they use a default
     value and you want to provide a value for them to use instead, you
     can find them and then provide the value you want to pass instead.
     For example, in the Firefox package, it uses a default value of
     'en-US' for `$locale`. If you want to change that, you can add
     `locale` and a value, which will replace `$locale` in the script,
     e.g. `choco download firefox --internalize locale=en-GB`.

## Examples

    choco download sysinternals

    #### [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) / Chocolatey for MSP
    choco download notepadplusplus --internalize
    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location \\server\share
    choco download notepadplusplus.install --internalize --resources-location http://somewhere/internal --append-useoriginallocation
    choco download KB3033929 --internalize -internalize-all-urls --append-useoriginallocation
    choco download firefox --internalize locale=es-AR

Coming soon

## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.
