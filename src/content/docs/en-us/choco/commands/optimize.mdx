# Optimize Command (choco optimize)

### Package Optimizer

Chocolatey [Licensed editions](https://chocolatey.org/compare) only.

Similar to Package Reducer, but reduces for existing packages.
With Package Optimizer/Reducer:

* nupkg file is reduced to 5KB or less, no matter the size.
* zips / installers are automatically removed from the package directory if they are found.
* zips / installers are removed from TEMP cache if found.

The following file extensions are removed automatically:

* 7z / zip / rar / gz / tar / sfx
* iso
* msi / msu / msp
* exe files if they are detected to be an installer



## Usage

    choco optimize [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco optimize
    choco optimize --reduce-nupkg-only


## See It In Action

Coming soon

## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes <Xref title="default options/switches" value="choco-commands" anchor="default-options-and-switches" /> (included below for completeness).
