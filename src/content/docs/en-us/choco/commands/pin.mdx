# Pin Command (choco pin)

Pin a package to suppress upgrades.

This is especially helpful when running <Xref title="`choco upgrade`" value="choco-command-upgrade" /> for all
 packages, as it will automatically skip those packages. Another
 alternative is `choco upgrade --except="pkg1,pk2"`.

## Usage

~~~sh
    choco pin [list]|add|remove [<options/switches>]
~~~

## Examples

    choco pin
    choco pin list
    choco pin add -n git
    choco pin add --name="'git'" --version="'1.2.3'"
    choco pin add --name="'git'" --version="'1.2.3'" --reason="'reasons available in business editions only'"
    choco pin remove --name="'git'"

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in <Xref title="how to pass arguments" value="choco-commands" anchor="how-to-pass-options-switches" /> (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes <Xref title="default options/switches" value="choco-commands" anchor="default-options-and-switches" /> (included below for completeness).
