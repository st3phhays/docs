# Synchronize Command (choco synchronize)

Business editions of Chocolatey starting at licensed version 1.9.0.

Synchronizes against the system installed software that are not 
 installed as packages on Chocolatey. Searches through the system to 
 see software that has been installed and generates packages from that
 software, baselines the packages against Chocolatey and makes the 
 packages available to upload to source.

See https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/package-synchronization/


## Usage

    choco sync [<options/switches>]

## Examples

    choco sync
    choco sync --id=putty
    choco sync --id=putty --package-id=putty

## See It In Action

Coming soon

## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [default options/switches](xref:choco-commands#default-options-and-switches) (included below for completeness).
