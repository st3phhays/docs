## Issue

In the nuspec in the `<tags />` element, the verifier found that the tags were separated with commas. They should only be separated with spaces.

## Recommended Solution

Please remove the commas from the `<tags />` element.

## Reasoning

We could just fix this on Chocolatey.org, but tags are used in other places besides just Chocolatey.org, and they are expected to be space separated.
