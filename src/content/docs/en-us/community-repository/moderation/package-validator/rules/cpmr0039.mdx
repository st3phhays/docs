## Issue

In the nuspec, there is a `<licenseUrl />` element. It was found to be missing or empty in the package.

## Recommended Solution

Please update the nuspec to include a `<licenseUrl />` element that is non-empty. If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

It is strongly encouraged to let folks know what licensing the particular underlying software from installing the package will carry so that decisions can be made ahead of time if it fits within the parameters of what the user can use depending on the setting they are in.
