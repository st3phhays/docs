## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`),

## Recommended Solution

Replace all uses of the cmdlet `Get-BinRoot` to use `Get-ToolsLocation` instead.

## Reasoning

The PowerShell cmdlet is badly named, and was replaced with a new cmdlet called `Get-ToolsLocation` instead.
The cmdlet is also deprecated in version 1.0.0 of Chocolatey and will be removed in version 2.0.0 so any calls
to the cmdlet should no longer be made.
