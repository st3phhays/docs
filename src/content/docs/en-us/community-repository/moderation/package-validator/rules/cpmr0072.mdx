## Issue

In an automation script (`.ps1`/`.psm1`) the scripts make use of either reading or writing private environment variables that should only be used by Chocolatey CLI helpers and not the automation scripts themselves.

## Recommended Solution

Remove any use of the following environment variables in the automation scripts.

- `chocolateyToolsLocation`
- `chocolateyBinRoot`
- `chocolatey_bin_root`
- `chocolateyPackageFolder`
- `packageFolder`
- `chocolateyChecksum32`
- `chocolateyChecksum64`
- `chocolateyChecksumType32`
- `chocolateyChecksumType64` 
- `downloadCacheAvailable`

### Chocolatey Tools Location

Any usages of the `chocolateyToolsLocation`, `chocolateyBinRoot`, or `chocolatey_bin_root` can be replaced with a call to <Xref title="Get-ToolsLocation" value="get-toolslocation" />. The `Get-ToolsLocation` helper is a wrapper that will provide the same information as directly reading the environment variable, but it also ensures that the variable is created if it did not previously exist.

### Chocolatey Package Folder

Replace usages of `chocolateyPackageFolder` or `packageFolder` with `Get-ChocolateyPath -PathType 'PackagePath'`. See the documentation for <Xref title="Get-ChocolateyPath" value="get-chocolateypath" /> for more information on the helper.

## Reasoning

The variables are used by the Chocolatey CLI helpers by including additional support and should not be used by the automation scripts themselves.
