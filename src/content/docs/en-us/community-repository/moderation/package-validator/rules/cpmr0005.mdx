## Issue

In the package, you have included binaries that you may have the right to distribute, but you have not included the license of the software to verify that.

## Recommended Solution

Please add the a file named LICENSE.txt. You can see the format for that file if you call `choco new test` and look at the generated file in `test\tools\LICENSE.txt`

This check also looks for `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `NOTICE.txt`, `NOTICE`, and `NOTICE.md`. Casing doesn't matter for validation.

## Reasoning

It is not enough to point to the License Url in the package (although make sure you do that to if one exists), as the contents of the Url could change or go away over time. The contents of the package are permanent and folks need to understand the licensing that applies with the included binaries. It also a protection for you, the package maintainer, to ensure the legitimacy of having distribution rights for the software that you packaged at the time you packaged when it may need to be verified 5 years down the line.
