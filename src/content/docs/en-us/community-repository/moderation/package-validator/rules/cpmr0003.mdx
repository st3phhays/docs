## Issue

Your script is named incorrectly and will need to be renamed. A script named `chocolateyInstall.ps1` was not found in your package, but another script ending in `install.ps1` was found.

## Recommended Solution

The install script should be named `chocolateyInstall.ps1` and be found in the tools folder.

## Reasoning

Chocolatey looks for a known/named script. Without it, Chocolatey can't run PowerShell automation.
