What is the validator?
The validator is a service that checks the quality of a package based on requirements, guidelines and suggestions for creating packages for Chocolateyâ€™s community feed. We like to think of the validator as unit testing. It is validating that everything is as it should be and meets the minimum requirements for a package on the community feed.
