description: Information on how to create your own Chocolatey package
---

Out of the box, Chocolatey comes with the ability for you to create your own Chocolatey packages.  At the heart of any Chocolatey package is <Xref title="PowerShell" value="packaging-for-the-masses" /> (the automation language for Windows), so anything that you can imagine can go into a Chocolatey Package.  This means that you can create a package for:

- Installers
- Binaries
- Zips
- Scripts
- Anything

We have <Xref title="comprehensive documentation" value="package-creation" /> on how to get started creating your first package, but if you want to jump straight in, after <Xref title="installing Chocolatey" value="setup-choco" />, run the following command:

```powershell
choco new mypackage
```

And Chocolatey will create a package, using its built in <Xref title="templating system" value="create-custom-package-templates" />, that also walks you through the process for finalizing your package.
