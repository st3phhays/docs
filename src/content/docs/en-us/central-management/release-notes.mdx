## 0.9.0 (June 15, 2022)

> :choco-warning: **WARNING**
>
> The dependencies of all the Chocolatey Central Management packages (`chocolatey-management-database`, `chocolatey-management-service`, and `chocolatey-management-web`) have changed in this release. This is to allow the installation of .NET 6.0, which is now a requirement to run Chocolatey Central Management.
>
> In addition to the above, all the Chocolatey Central Management packages now make use of the commercial cmdlets, which means that these packages _have_ to be installed on a correctly licensed machine.

</div>

## 0.5.0 (March 25, 2021)

### Breaking Changes

- Deployments - Provide better resiliency when handling large numbers of computers within a Deployment Plan - see [Licensed #212](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues/issues/212)

Previously, while not recommended, the CCM Service could be run as a user with non-administrative rights on the machine, as long as certain permissions were provided to the user.  Going forward, there is now a strict requirement that the user that is running the CCM Service has administrative rights on the machine.  This is needed to ensure reliability of messages delivered into the CCM Service.
