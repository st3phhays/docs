## Creating An _All Computers_ Group and Deploy Application Upgrades

From a completely fresh CCM instance with at least one computer checking into Central Management, this process will:

- Create a new group containing all the computers currently registered to Central Management.
- Create a new Deployment Plan with a single step, which will upgrade all Chocolatey-managed applications to the latest available versions.
- Start the Deployment Plan.

The process involves a couple of intermediary steps as well, since we're using the raw REST API endpoints here (see below).
We're also assuming as part of this example that you've already [Authenticated to the CCM API](#authentication) and have a `$Session` variable created as in that example.

### 1. Get All CCM-Managed Computers

```powershell
$CcmServerHostname = 'chocoserver'
$params = @{
    Uri        = "https://$CCmServerHostname/api/services/app/Computers/GetAll"
    Method     = 'GET'
    WebSession = $Session
}
$ComputerList = Invoke-RestMethod @params
```

### 2. Create an _All Computers_ Group

```powershell
# Create group in CCM
$GroupName = 'All Clients'
$Params = @{
    Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/Groups/CreateOrEdit"
    Method      = 'POST'
    WebSession  = $Session
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body        = @{
        name        = $GroupName
        description = 'All CCM client machines'
        groups      = @()
        computers   = @(
            $ComputerList.result | Select-Object -Property @{ Name = 'computerId'; Expression = { "$($_.id)" } }
        )
    } | ConvertTo-Json
}
$null = Invoke-RestMethod @params

# Retrieve created group information
$params = @{
    Uri        = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/Groups/GetAll"
    Method     = "GET"
    WebSession = $Session
}
$Group = Invoke-RestMethod @params |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty result |
    Where-Object Name -EQ $GroupName
```

### 3. Create a New Deployment Plan

```powershell
$params = @{
    Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/CreateOrEdit"
    Method      = "POST"
    WebSession  = $Session
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body        = @{ name = "Upgrade Chocolatey-Managed Applications [$(Get-Date)]" } | ConvertTo-Json
}
$deployment = (Invoke-RestMethod @params).result
```

### 4. Add a Deployment Step

```powershell
$params = @{
    Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentSteps/CreateOrEdit"
    Method      = "POST"
    WebSession  = $Session
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body        = @{
        deploymentPlanId               = $deployment.Id
        name                           = "Choco Upgrade All"
        validExitCodes                 = "0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010"
        executionTimeoutInSeconds      = 14400
        machineContactTimeoutInMinutes = "0"
        failOnError                    = $true
        requireSuccessOnAllComputers   = $false
        deploymentStepGroups           = @(
            @{ groupId = $Group.Id; groupName = $Group.Name }
        )
        # Syntax for basic Deployment Steps is "<ChocoCommand>|<PackageName>"
        script                         = "upgrade|all"
    } | ConvertTo-Json
}
$null = Invoke-RestMethod @params
```

### 5. Move Deployment Plan to Ready & Start the Deployment Plan

```powershell
$params = @{
    Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/MoveToReady"
    Method      = "POST"
    WebSession  = $Session
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body        = @{ id = $deployment.Id } | ConvertTo-Json
}
$null = Invoke-RestMethod @params

$params = @{
    Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/Start"
    Method      = "POST"
    WebSession  = $Session
    ContentType = 'application/json'
    Body        = @{ id = $deployment.Id } | ConvertTo-Json
}
$null = Invoke-RestMethod @params
```

## Create a Recurring Scheduled Task to run Recurring Deployment Plans

This example uses the concepts in the previous example and streamlines the process of creating a scheduled task on Windows to create a recurring Deployment Plan task.
In this example, we set the trigger to run daily, but you could configure it to run as needed for your use case.

```powershell
$recurringDeploymentScript = {
    # Fill in the CCM Server name as well as the Group ID that the Deployment Step will target
    $CcmServerHostname = 'chocoserver'
    $GroupId = 1

    # Authenticate to API
    # NOTE: This is an example only; it's never a great idea to store your credentials in a script or scheduled task.
    # Instead, store the credentials securely and retrieve them during the scheduled task script.
    $body = @{
        usernameOrEmailAddress = 'ccmadmin'
        password               = 'ch0c0R0cks'
    }

    $null = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://$CcmServerHostname/Account/Login" -Method POST -ContentType 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -Body $body -SessionVariable Session -ErrorAction Stop

    # Create New Deployment Plan
    $params = @{
        Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/CreateOrEdit"
        Method      = "POST"
        WebSession  = $Session
        ContentType = 'application/json'
        Body        = @{ name = "Upgrade Chocolatey-Managed Applications [$(Get-Date)]" } | ConvertTo-Json
    }
    $deployment = (Invoke-RestMethod @params).result

    # Add Deployment Step
    $params = @{
        Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentSteps/CreateOrEdit"
        Method      = "POST"
        WebSession  = $Session
        ContentType = 'application/json'
        Body        = @{
            deploymentPlanId               = $deployment.Id
            name                           = "Choco Upgrade All"
            validExitCodes                 = "0, 1605, 1614, 1641, 3010"
            executionTimeoutInSeconds      = 14400
            machineContactTimeoutInMinutes = "0"
            failOnError                    = $true
            requireSuccessOnAllComputers   = $false
            deploymentStepGroups           = @(
                @{ groupId = $GroupId }
            )
            script                         = "upgrade|all"
        } | ConvertTo-Json
    }
    $null = Invoke-RestMethod @params

    # Move Deployment Plan to Ready & Start the Deployment Plan
    $params = @{
        Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/MoveToReady"
        Method      = "POST"
        WebSession  = $Session
        ContentType = 'application/json'
        Body        = @{ id = $deployment.Id } | ConvertTo-Json
    }
    $null = Invoke-RestMethod @params

    $params = @{
        Uri         = "https://$CcmServerHostname/api/services/app/DeploymentPlans/Start"
        Method      = "POST"
        WebSession  = $Session
        ContentType = 'application/json'
        Body        = @{ id = $deployment.Id } | ConvertTo-Json
    }
    $null = Invoke-RestMethod @params
}

$argumentString = '-NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "& {{ {0} }}"' -f $recurringDeploymentScript

$taskParams = @{
    Action      = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' -Argument $argumentString
    # Fill in the requirements for the repeating scheduled task; here, it will trigger once a day @ 6 PM
    Trigger     = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 6pm
    TaskName    = 'Repeat - Choco Update Deployment'
    Description = "Create and start a Chocolatey Central Management Deployment Plan which will trigger all computers in the group '$groupName' to update their Chocolatey-managed applications."
}

Register-ScheduledTask @taskParams
```
