# Package Builder Command (choco new)

Chocolatey [Licensed editions](https://chocolatey.org/compare) include some level of Package Builder.

 - Professional can take advantage of Package Builder UI minus the auto-detection
 - Business can use `--file` or Package Builder UI to generate a fully 
   ready to go unattended software deployment in seconds. So easy a 7
   year old can do it. Right Click 'Create Package...'
 - Business can use `--from-programs-and-features` to generate packages
   directly from Programs and Features! 

See more information about [Package Builder features](xref:package-builder)


# New Command (choco new)

Chocolatey will generate package specification files for a new package.

## Usage

    choco new <name> [<options/switches>] [<property=value> <propertyN=valueN>]

Possible properties to pass:
    packageversion
    maintainername
    maintainerrepo
    installertype
    url
    url64
    silentargs

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> You can pass arbitrary property value pairs
 through to templates. This really unlocks your ability to create
 packages automatically!

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) can create complete packages by just
 pointing the new command to native installers!

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> [Chocolatey for Business](https://chocolatey.org/compare) can also download and internalize remote
 resources from existing packages so that existing packages can be used
 without being tied to the internet.
 This is called automatic recompile.

## Examples

    choco new bob
    choco new bob -a --version 1.2.0 maintainername="'This guy'"
    choco new bob silentargs="'/S'" url="'https://somewhere/out/there.msi'"
    choco new bob --outputdirectory Packages

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> See scripting in [how to pass arguments](xref:choco-commands#how-to-pass-options-switches) (`choco -?`) for how to
 write proper scripts and integrations.


## Exit Codes

Exit codes that normally result from running this command.

Normal:
 - 0: operation was successful, no issues detected
 - -1 or 1: an error has occurred

If you find other exit codes that we have not yet documented, please
 file a ticket so we can document it at
 https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/new/choose.


## Options and Switches

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Options and switches apply to all items passed, so if you are
 running a command like install that allows installing multiple
 packages, and you use `--version=1.0.0`, it is going to look for and
 try to install version 1.0.0 of every package passed. So please split
 out multiple package calls when wanting to pass specific options.

Includes [default options/switches](xref:choco-commands#default-options-and-switches) (included below for completeness).
