## Syntax

~~~powershell
Get-ChocolateyWebFile `
  -PackageName <String> `
  -FileFullPath <String> `
  [-Url <String>] `
  [-Url64bit <String>] `
  [-Checksum <String>] `
  [-ChecksumType <String>] `
  [-Checksum64 <String>] `
  [-ChecksumType64 <String>] `
  [-Options <Hashtable>] `

  [-ForceDownload] `
  [-IgnoredArguments <Object[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
~~~

## Description

This will download a file from a url, tracking with a progress bar.
It returns the filepath to the downloaded file when it is complete.

## Notes

Chocolatey works best when the packages contain the software it is
managing and doesn't require downloads. However most software in the
Windows world requires redistribution rights and when sharing packages
publicly (like on the [community feed](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages)), maintainers may not have those
aforementioned rights. Chocolatey understands how to work with that,
hence this function. You are not subject to this limitation with
internal packages.

## Aliases

None

## Examples

 **EXAMPLE 1**

## Inputs

None

## Outputs

None

## Parameters

###  -PackageName &lt;String&gt;
The name of the package - while this is an arbitrary value, it's
recommended that it matches the package id.

Property               | Value
---------------------- | -----
Aliases                | 
Required?              | true
Position?              | 1
Default Value          | 
Accept Pipeline Input? | false
 
###  -FileFullPath &lt;String&gt;
This is the full path of the resulting file name.

Property               | Value
---------------------- | -----
Aliases                | 
Required?              | true
Position?              | 2
Default Value          | 
Accept Pipeline Input? | false
 
###  -Url [&lt;String&gt;]
This is the 32 bit url to download the resource from. This resource can
be used on 64 bit systems when a package has both a Url and Url64bit
specified if a user passes `--forceX86`. If there is only a 64 bit url
available, please remove do not use the parameter (only use Url64bit).
Will fail on 32bit systems if missing or if a user attempts to force
a 32 bit installation on a 64 bit system.

Prefer HTTPS when available. Can be HTTP, FTP, or File URIs.

Property               | Value
---------------------- | -----
Aliases                | 
Required?              | false
Position?              | 3
Default Value          | 
Accept Pipeline Input? | false
 
###  -Url64bit [&lt;String&gt;]
OPTIONAL - If there is a 64 bit resource available, use this
parameter. Chocolatey will automatically determine if the user is
running a 64 bit OS or not and adjust accordingly. Please note that
the 32 bit url will be used in the absence of this. This parameter
should only be used for 64 bit native software. If the original Url
contains both (which is quite rare), set this to '$url' Otherwise
remove this parameter.

Prefer HTTPS when available. Can be HTTP, FTP, or File URIs.

`Url64` is an alias for Url64bit.

Property               | Value
---------------------- | -----
Aliases                | url64
Required?              | false
Position?              | 4
Default Value          | 
Accept Pipeline Input? | false
 
###  -Checksum [&lt;String&gt;]
The checksum hash value of the Url resource. This allows a checksum to
be validated for files that are not local. The checksum type is covered
by ChecksumType.

> :choco-info: **NOTE**
>
> Checksums in packages are meant as a measure to validate the
originally intended file that was used in the creation of a package is
the same file that is received at a future date. Since this is used for
other steps in the process related to the [community repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages), it
ensures that the file a user receives is the same file a maintainer
and a moderator (if applicable), plus any moderation review has
intended for you to receive with this package. If you are looking at a
remote source that uses the same url for updates, you will need to
ensure the package also stays updated in line with those remote
resource updates. You should look into <Xref title="automatic packaging" value="automatic-packaging" />
to help provide that functionality.

Property               | Value
---------------------- | -----
Aliases                | 
Required?              | false
Position?              | named
Default Value          | 
Accept Pipeline Input? | false
 
###  -ChecksumType [&lt;String&gt;]
The type of checksum that the file is validated with - valid
values are 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256' or 'sha512' - defaults to 'md5'.

MD5 is not recommended as certain organizations need to use FIPS
compliant algorithms for hashing - see
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/811833 for more details.

The recommendation is to use at least SHA256.

###  -Checksum64 [&lt;String&gt;]

resource. This allows a checksum to be validated for files that are not
local. The checksum type is covered by ChecksumType64.

> To determine checksums, you can get that from the original
site if provided. You can also use the [checksum tool available on
the community feed](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/checksum) (`choco install checksum`)
and use it e.g. `checksum -t sha256 -f path\to\file`. Ensure you
provide checksums for all remote resources used.
