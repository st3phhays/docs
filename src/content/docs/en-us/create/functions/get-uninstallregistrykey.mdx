Retrieve registry key(s) for system-installed applications from an
exact or wildcard search.

## Syntax

~~~powershell
Get-UninstallRegistryKey `
  -SoftwareName <String> `
  [-IgnoredArguments <Object[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
~~~

## Description

This function will attempt to retrieve a matching registry key for an
already installed application, usually to be used with a
chocolateyUninstall.ps1 automation script.

The function also prevents `Get-ItemProperty` from failing when
handling wrongly encoded registry keys.


## Aliases

`Get-InstallRegistryKey`


## Examples

 **EXAMPLE 1**

~~~powershell

# Version match: Software name is "Gpg4Win (2.3.0)"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "Gpg4win (*)"
$key.UninstallString
~~~

**EXAMPLE 2**

~~~powershell

# Fuzzy match: Software name is "Launchy 2.5"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "Launchy*"
$key.UninstallString
~~~

**EXAMPLE 3**

~~~powershell

# Exact match: Software name in Programs and Features is "VLC media player"
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "VLC media player"
$key.UninstallString
~~~

**EXAMPLE 4**

~~~powershell

#  Version match: Software name is "SketchUp 2016"
# Note that the similar software name "SketchUp Viewer" would not be matched.
[array]$key = Get-UninstallRegistryKey -SoftwareName "SketchUp [0-9]*"
$key.UninstallString
~~~ 

## Inputs

None

## Outputs


 * This function searches registry objects and returns an array
of PSCustomObject with the matched key's properties.
 * Retrieve properties with dot notation, for example:
`$key.UninstallString`


## Parameters

###  -SoftwareName &lt;String&gt;
Part or all of the Display Name as you see it in Programs and Features.
It should be enough to be unique.
The syntax follows the rules of the PowerShell `-like` operator, so the
`*` character is interpreted as a wildcard, which matches any (zero or
more) characters.

If the display name contains a version number, such as "Launchy (2.5)",
it is recommended you use a fuzzy search `"Launchy (*)"` (the wildcard
`*`) so if Launchy auto-updates or is updated outside of Chocolatey, the
uninstall script will not fail.

Take care not to abuse fuzzy/glob pattern searches. Be conscious of
programs that may have shared or common root words to prevent
overmatching. For example, "SketchUp*" would match two keys with
software names "SketchUp 2016" and "SketchUp Viewer" that are different
programs released by the same company.
